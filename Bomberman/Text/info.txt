	OPERATION OF THE GAME:
		Bomberman's goal is to reach the surface of the earth. However, his initial point of departure is deep in the bowel of the earth,
		so Bomberman must search for exitways and make his way upwards, level by level. Of course, enemy forces are lurking throughout
		the labyrinth, and Bomberman must overcome each and everyone in order to advance to the next level. If he should touch any of the
		enemy or be caught in the flames of exploding bombs, he's out for the count, so extreme caution is urged. The exitways are concealed
		among the boxes and can only be found when all the enemies are killed, also concealed are the "power - up" panels, which Bomberman 
		collects in order to increase his power.
	
		"BOMBS"
		In the earliest stage of the game, only one bomb can be set at a time and it has very weak firepower. As "power - up" panels are 
		taken in, the bombs easier to use and more lethal.
	
		"CONCRETE"
		Concrete walls aren't damaged by bomb fires, so Bomberman can take shelter from exploding bombs.
	
		"BOXES"
		These dissolve when hit by the flames of exploding bombs.
	
		"EXITWAYS"
		There are to found among the boxes. After overcoming all enemies, Bomberman stands over the exitways to proceed to the next level.
	
		"POWER - UP PANELS"
		These panels turn up occasionally among the explosions. There are several different types of panels with different effects:
 
		"HEART" - extra life
		"ICE CREAM" - restates the timer
		"FIRE" - increase bomb power
		"BOMB" - increase bomb amount
		"SKATE" - increase Bomberman's speed
		"POTION" - Bomberman cam walk through boxes
